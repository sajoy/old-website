            <p>
                I make things with JavaScript. I ‚ù§ hot keys, ice cream, cats, and learning/thinking about how and why things work/exist.
                I co-lead JavaScript Study Nights for Women Who Code Portland.
                Previously: Instructor at Alchemy Code Lab, Web App Developer at Cardsmith. 
                Currently: I'm looking for remote work on either end of the stack. Ideally with a company or product that 
                encourages creativity and growth in their employees and their end users.

                "But if poetry is your goal,
                you've got to forget all about
                punishments and all about rewards
                and all about selfstyled obligations and duties
                and responsibilities etcetera ad infinitum and
                remember one thing only: that it's you&mdash;nobody else&mdash;who 
                determine your destiny and decide your fate.
                Nobody else can be alive for you;
                nor can you be alive for anybody else.
                Toms can be Dicks and Dicks can be Harrys,
                but none of them can ever be you.
                There's the artist's responsibility;
                and <span class="awful">the most awful</span> responsibility on earth.
                If you can take it, take it&mdash;and be.
                If you can't, cheer up,
                and go about other people's business;
                and do (or undo) till you drop."
